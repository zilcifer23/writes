Instructions : what to do, written for hardware to understand. (referred to as programs)  
  
tasks : execution of said instructions

1. threads : tasks that share memory
    
2. processes: tasks that do not share memory
    

processor : physical hardware able to handle tasks, one at a time.  
  
so if you want multiple tasks to be run, you need to have multiple physical units do the work.  
  
programming patterns  
  
sync : blocking  
async : non-blocking

concurrency  
parallelism
